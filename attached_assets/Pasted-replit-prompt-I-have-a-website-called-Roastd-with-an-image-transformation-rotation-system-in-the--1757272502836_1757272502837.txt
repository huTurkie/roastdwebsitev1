replit prompt

I have a website called "Roastd" with an image transformation rotation system in the first section. The system shows a main black and white picture that alternates with different transformation examples to demonstrate what users can do.

Current Setup:

Main image file: attached_assets/main pic web_1757164517069.jpeg (black and white baseline)
Rotation interval: 3 seconds per image
Always returns to main picture between each transformation
Current Transformation Sequence:

Main picture → "Enter your roast or transformation prompt here..."
Magical effect → "Add a magical effect around them ✨"
Main picture → "Enter your roast or transformation prompt here..."
Robot → "Turn them into a robot 🤖"
Main picture → "Enter your roast or transformation prompt here..."
Superhero → "Turn them into a superhero 🦸"
Main picture → "Enter your roast or transformation prompt here..."
Movie poster → "Put them in a movie poster 🎬"
Main picture → "Enter your roast or transformation prompt here..."
Outer space → "Put them in outer space 🚀"
Main picture → "Enter your roast or transformation prompt here..."
Historical figure → "Make them a historical figure 👑"
Main picture → "Enter your roast or transformation prompt here..."
Famous painting → "Put them in a famous painting 🖼️"
Main picture → "Enter your roast or transformation prompt here..."
Outfit swap → "Swap their outfit with someone famous 👗"
Cycle repeats

The system is currently working perfectly with all transformations rotating properly. Any new additions should follow the same alternating pattern: Main picture → New transformation → Main picture.
